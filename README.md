Raw and processed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) data for the manuscript "Insights into the collagenolytic mechanism of MMP-1 from trapping the enzyme in its compact state".

- This repository contains 5 files, 4 raw .txt files and the processed, analysed data ("THP-MMP-1' equilibrium binding least-squares fitting.xlsx").
- Each .txt file contains data from triplicate experiments examining the equilibrium binding response ("RelResp [RU]", column 6) against the MMP-1[E219A] variant sample concentration in µg/mL ("Sample_1_Conc [µg/ml]", column 8).
- The Excel file contains multiple worksheets, one for each SPR experiment, one summarising the SPR data for each MMP-1 variant, and a summary worksheet for the entire SPR investigation.
